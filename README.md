This is a platform for story lovers to connect and archive stories they read. I wanted a platform mainly for readers to enjoy!
I found a platform similar to this that captures a bit of what I had in mind for a engaging with other readers--
[StoryGraph](https://thestorygraph.com/). I learned of this application/site recently (as I had already had Archivus in 
it's ideation/design stages long before I knew of it), and I really like the Buddy Read feature, where you can add people and 
make comments at certain parts of a story. I wanted to add feature similar to mine, but I want this platform to focus more on 
user engagement with others (instead of tracking like StoryGraph).

## Name
Also, I feel like a genius with the name Archivus--because "archive with us." teehee >.<

## In Progress
Currently in the beginning stages of home and login/signup sections! Will update and commit when I can :p
